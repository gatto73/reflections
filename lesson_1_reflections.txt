How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

We start with a version of the prgram that was working. Then we analyse only the
parts of the code that have been modified. This help to make sure we are
checking all the partes that have been modified and do not miss any.
Furthermore we can check if some part of the program has been modified by
mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

I will be able to check the previous versions of the code in case some bug is
introduced in the successive versions. I will not loose any change to the code
by mistake. I will have always a backup of my files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

PROS
====
- In programming we want to save commint according to logical changes, this can
be done only by letting the programmer to choose when to save.

CONS
====
- There is the risk to make big changes forgetting to save regularly the files.
But by a proper strategy of saving by logical changes this will be avoid.
- The programmer could forget to save after he has applied a (logical) change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Services like Goole Docs are ment to store file that in most cases are not
related to each other. Then it makes sense to manage the saving of the files
differently.
Git is ment to be used for code development. code is often managed by a program
that is made by multiple files that are related to eache other. Then the commit
will save the status of the program, not the status ao a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

To view the history of all the commits in a repository:

    $ git log

To view the history of all the commits with some more information, add the
option --stat:

    $ git log --stat    

To view the diff between to commints:

    $ git diff id_old_commit id_new_commit

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

When I break something now I can go back to teh history of all the changes and
see when the problem was introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use git and GitHub to manage my dotfiles, especially the configuration
for spacemacs.
