When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository for the following pourposes:
- Share code and collaborate with some other people
- Have a backup of all my repositories in case of a problem on my local computer
- Have access to the repository from everywhere
- Work on the repository from different computer or even differnt OS on the same computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
