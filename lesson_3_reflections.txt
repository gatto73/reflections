When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository for the following pourposes:
- Share code and collaborate with some other people
- Have a backup of all my repositories in case of a problem on my local computer
- Have access to the repository from everywhere
- Work on the repository from different computer or even differnt OS on the same computer
